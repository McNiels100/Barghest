# About Barghest
It is a small first-time Ruby project.
Being a fan of Cyberpunk 2077 I wanted to feel like a Netrunner. So I made a harmless malware script that:

1. Plays song The Heist - P.T. Adamczyk.
2. Loops through Barghest ASCII pixel art in the terminal.
3. Open 20 images of the Barghest logo.
4. Changes wallpaper.
5. Works on Linux (Gnome-based), Windows (restarts to refreash wallpaper change), macOS.
